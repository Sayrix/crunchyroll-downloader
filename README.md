Downloads anime from Crunchyroll and outputs them in a MKV file.

You won't be banned or anything, I downloaded all Kaguya-Sama seasons to test during 30 mins and everything went fine

## Features

- Supports choosing the audio and subtitles language, including downloading multiple of each into a single file
- Supports choosing the audio and video quality
- Decrypts Widevine DRM (requires: a `.wvd` file or `client_id.bin` and `private_key.pem` files)
- Adds metadata (like episode name) to the MKV container
- Parallel segment downloads (10 workers) for faster downloads
- Retry with backoff on connection errors
- Batch download from a list of URLs
- Optional per-process WireGuard tunnel for Crunchyroll and CDN traffic

## Requirements

- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages)
- To download Premium-only content, a Crunchyroll Premium account. No, this can't be bypassed and a free trial should be enough
- Either a `.wvd` file, or a `client_id.bin` and `private_key.pem`

## Download

Check the [latest release](https://github.com/CuteTenshii/crunchyroll-downloader/releases/latest) and download the file that corresponds to your OS.

## Usage

- Open a Terminal/Command prompt, and go to the folder where you downloaded the binary/cloned the repo
- Run the program with the options you want:
```shell
Usage of ./crunchyroll-downloader:
  -audio-lang string
        Audio language(s), comma-separated (e.g. "ja-JP,en-US"). Add ALL for every available dub; explicit languages lead, the first available track is default, and ALL alone prefers ja-JP (default "ja-JP")
  -audio-quality string
        Audio quality (default "192k")
  -cc-lang string
        Closed caption language(s), comma-separated (e.g. "en-US,ALL"). Add ALL for every available caption; downloaded in addition to --subs-lang
  -debug-manifest
        Log raw episode playback JSON and manifest XML
  -download-delay duration
        Minimum delay between episode downloads, to help avoid Crunchyroll's rate limiting (e.g. "30s", "2m")
  -etp-rt string
        The "etp_rt" cookie value of your account
  -file string
        Path to a text file with one URL per line
  -season int
        Season number. Not used if an episode link is entered
  -subs-lang string
        Subtitle language(s), comma-separated (e.g. "fr-FR,ALL"). Add ALL for every available subtitle; explicit languages lead, the first available track is default, and ALL alone prefers en-US (default "en-US")
  -url string
        URL of the episode/season to download
  -video-quality string
        Video quality (default "1080p")
  -wireguard-file string
        Path to a WireGuard config file; route this download's HTTP traffic and DNS through its peer
```

Ex: to download the first season of *Hell's Paradise*:
```shell
./crunchyroll-downloader --url https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GJ0H7Q5ZJ/hells-paradise --season 1 --etp-rt replace_this
```

To download a specific episode:
```shell
./crunchyroll-downloader --url https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/GE00198973JAJP/dawn-and-confusion --etp-rt replace_this
```

To batch download from a file (one URL per line):
```shell
./crunchyroll-downloader --file list.txt --etp-rt replace_this --subs-lang pt-BR
```

To download multiple audio tracks and subtitles into a single file (the first available requested track of each kind is set as the default):
```shell
./crunchyroll-downloader --url https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/GE00198973JAJP/dawn-and-confusion --etp-rt replace_this --audio-lang ja-JP,en-US --subs-lang en-US,es-419,de-DE
```

Use `ALL` in any of the three language lists to add every language available for each episode. Explicit languages keep their listed order ahead of the remaining languages, which are added alphabetically without duplicates. For example, `--subs-lang fr-FR,ALL` makes French the default subtitle when available and adds the other subtitles as secondary tracks. `--audio-lang en-US,ALL` does the same for audio. With `ALL` alone, `ja-JP` is the default audio and `en-US` the default subtitle when available; otherwise, the first language alphabetically becomes the default. Closed captions are separate from normal subtitles and are never default tracks. `--cc-lang ALL` adds every available caption alongside the subtitles selected by `--subs-lang`, including captions found on other dub versions.

Missing explicitly requested audio languages are skipped, and the episode is skipped only when no requested audio is available. Missing explicitly requested subtitles or captions are skipped. `ALL` only adds tracks available for that episode.

```shell
./crunchyroll-downloader --url https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/GE00198973JAJP/dawn-and-confusion --etp-rt replace_this --audio-lang ja-JP,ALL --subs-lang fr-FR,ALL --cc-lang ALL
```

### Use a WireGuard location for this download

Pass a WireGuard `.conf` file with `--wireguard-file` to route the downloader's authentication, playback, license, subtitles, media segments, and DNS through that peer. This uses an in-process WireGuard network stack: it does not change your PC's routes or disconnect its existing VPN. The outer WireGuard UDP connection still follows your PC's current route, so the existing VPN must allow that connection. If the tunnel cannot carry a request, the download fails instead of falling back to the PC's normal route.

```shell
./crunchyroll-downloader --url https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/GE00198973JAJP/dawn-and-confusion --etp-rt replace_this --wireguard-file path/to/location.conf
```

The file must contain one `[Interface]` and one `[Peer]`, with `PrivateKey`, `Address`, an IP-based `DNS` server, `PublicKey`, `Endpoint`, and `AllowedIPs`. The interface address and the peer's `AllowedIPs` need a matching full-tunnel route (`0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4 and/or `::/0` for IPv6). `MTU`, `ListenPort`, `PresharedKey`, and `PersistentKeepalive` are supported. Configs that need system routes, hooks such as `PostUp`, multiple peers, or DNS search domains are rejected. An endpoint hostname is resolved using the PC's current network before the tunnel is established; use an IP endpoint if that matters to you.

If you're getting rate-limited while downloading a season/batch, wait at least this long between each episode:
```shell
./crunchyroll-downloader --url https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GJ0H7Q5ZJ/hells-paradise --season 1 --etp-rt replace_this --download-delay 30s
```

If Crunchyroll rate-limits an episode anyway, it's retried in place (starting at `-download-delay`, or 1 minute if unset, doubling up to 30 minutes on repeated hits) instead of moving on to the next episode and tripping the same limit again.

### What is a `.wvd` file and do I really need one?

Yes, Crunchyroll uses DRM-only content. This file is used to get a Widevine license, which gives the keys to decrypt the media.

If you don't have a rooted Android device or are just lazy, search "ready to use cdms" and you'll find plenty of websites providing those files.
